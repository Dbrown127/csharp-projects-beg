# C Sharp Projects for Beginners
This repository contains basic projects including the popular FizzBuzz coding challenge, Task Tracker CLI, and a Secure User Management System CLI.

## FizzBuzz Game - Divisibility Challenge üïπÔ∏è
### Description
The FizzBuzz Game is a classic coding challenge that tests basic programming skills. The rules are simple:

Enter 5 numbers between 1 and 100. For each number:
- "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5 (10 points).
- "Fizz" if divisible by 3 (5 points).
- "Buzz" if divisible by 5 (5 points).
- Otherwise, 1 point.

### Preview of CLI

### Technical Notes üíª
- **Model Class (FizzBuzz):** Encapsulates game logic by determining "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "Number" with associated points.
- **Service Class (FizzBuzzService):** Handles core game logic, storing user inputs, and tallying points.
- **Interactive CLI:** Provides an engaging user experience, displaying rules and collecting validated inputs.
- **XML Documentation:** Comprehensive code comments using XML, aiding in understanding and maintaining the codebase.

- **OG Rules**:
Fizz Buzz Problem states that given an integer n, for every integer i <= n, the task is to print ‚ÄúFizzBuzz‚Äù if i is divisible by 3 and 5, ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù if i is divisible by 3, ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù if i is divisible by 5 or i (as a string) if none of the conditions are true.

## FizzBuzz Arcade API üéÆ
### Description
The **FizzBuzz Arcade API** extends the original FizzBuzz game into a web API format. The API exposes game functionality via HTTP endpoints, allowing external clients to interact with the FizzBuzz logic programmatically.

### Key Topics Discussed:
- **API for Games/Services**: Unlike CRUD-based APIs, this API focuses on providing computational services, maintaining game state, and handling operations like calculating FizzBuzz, counting results, and tallying points.
- **Model Binding and Validation**: Using data transfer objects (DTOs) and model binding to validate input sizes and constraints, ensuring only valid data is processed.
- **Dependency Injection and Service Registration**: Registering services with different lifetimes (`Singleton`, `Scoped`, etc.) to manage game state across API requests.
- **Mapping Data Objects**: Converting internal game data into API-friendly formats (DTOs) for easy consumption by clients.
- **Developing with SOLID Principles**: Following principles like Single Responsibility, Dependency Inversion, and Interface Segregation to keep the codebase modular and maintainable.

### Preview of API Endpoints
- `POST /api/FizzBuzz/values` - Save a list of FizzBuzz values.
- `DELETE /api/FizzBuzz/clear` - Clear previous results to reset the game state.
- `GET /api/FizzBuzz/count` - Get the count of Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.
- `GET /api/FizzBuzz/points` - Get the total points.
- `GET /api/FizzBuzz/values` - Get all saved values.

## Task Tracker Console üìä
Task Tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. This project helps practice programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.

### Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:

- Add, Update, and Delete tasks
- Mark a task as `TODO`, `PENDING`, or `COMPLETE`
- List all tasks
- List all tasks that are complete
- List all tasks that are not done
- List all tasks that are in progress

### Task Tracker API üìä
### Description
The **Task Tracker API** builds upon the CLI version, converting it into a RESTful API for managing tasks via HTTP requests. The API is designed around CRUD operations for managing task data.

### Key Topics Discussed:
- **API for Data Management**: This API focuses on CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks, making it a typical data management API.
- **Model Binding and Validation**: Using DTOs and model binding to validate input data and ensure proper formatting.
- **Dependency Injection and Service Registration**: Leveraging DI to register services like `TaskManager` to handle task operations, maintaining separation of concerns.
- **Mapping Data Objects**: Converting between domain models and DTOs for consistent API responses.
- **Developing with SOLID Principles**: Emphasizing code maintainability and readability through SOLID principles like Open/Closed and Single Responsibility.

### Preview of API Endpoints
- `POST /api/TaskTracker/tasks` - Add a new task.
- `GET /api/TaskTracker/tasks` - List all tasks.
- `PUT /api/TaskTracker/tasks/{id}` - Update a task.
- `DELETE /api/TaskTracker/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task.

### Constraints
- The JSON file should be created if it does not exist.
- Use the native file system module of your programming language to interact with the JSON file.
- Do not use any external libraries or frameworks to build this project.
- Ensure to handle errors and edge cases gracefully.

## Secure User Management CLI üîê
### Description
This project focuses on creating a **Secure User Management system** with login and registration functionality. It implements seamless user input, validation, error handling, password hashing, and service injection, ensuring a secure and smooth user experience.

### Key Features:
- **User Login & Registration**: Handles user sign-in and sign-up processes with username and password.
- **Password Hashing**: Utilizes cryptographic hashing to securely store user passwords.
- **Input Validation**: Validates user inputs (e.g., username and password) with robust rules, ensuring correct data is provided.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages errors such as invalid credentials or missing user data.
- **Service Injection**: Injects external services like `_userManager` to handle user data and authentication, ensuring a clean, modular architecture.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests to verify the functionality of login, registration, and password validation logic.

### Preview of CLI
Users can enter their credentials through the CLI, with error messages displayed upon invalid login attempts, prompting the user to re-enter information without overwhelming the console.

```csharp
private void Login()
{
    string username;
    string password;
    bool isValidUser;
    bool firstAttempt = true;

    do
    {
        if (!firstAttempt)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid login. Please try again.");
        }

        // Re-prompt for username and password
        username = UserInputValidator.GetValidatedUsername(prompt: "Enter Username: ");
        password = UserInputValidator.GetValidatedPassword(prompt: "Enter Password: "); // Password IS case sensitive

        var loginInfo = new LoginInfo
        {
            Username = username,
            Password = password
        };

        // Try logging in the user
        isValidUser = _userManager.LoginUser(loginInfo);

        firstAttempt = false;

    } while (!isValidUser);

    Console.WriteLine("Login successful!");
    Console.ReadKey();
}
```

### Technical Notes üíª
- **Input Validation**: Ensures usernames meet specific criteria (e.g., minimum length) and passwords are case-sensitive.
- **Dependency Injection**: The `_userManager` service manages users and authentication.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Smooth error handling to avoid clearing the console and confusing users. Failed attempts are simply re-prompted with minimal disruption.



This Secure User Management CLI provides a simple yet powerful way to handle user credentials securely in C#.
