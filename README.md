# C Sharp Projects for Begginners
This repository contains basic projects including the popular FizzBuzz coding challenge.

## FizzBuzz Divisibility Challange
**Rules**:
Fizz Buzz Problem states that given an integer n, for every integer i <= n, the task is to print “FizzBuzz” if i is divisible by 3 and 5, “Fizz” if i is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if i is divisible by 5 or i (as a string) if none of the conditions are true.
